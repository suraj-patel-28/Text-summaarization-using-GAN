# Text Summarization using GANs with CNN Dataset

## Overview

This project implements a text summarization model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is trained on the CNN dataset to generate concise and informative summaries of news articles. By leveraging the power of GANs, the model aims to produce high-quality summaries that are both accurate and human-like.

## Features

- **Generative Adversarial Networks**: Utilizes GANs where a generator creates summaries and a discriminator evaluates their quality against reference summaries.
- **CNN Dataset**: Trained on the widely-used CNN dataset, which consists of news articles and their corresponding summaries.
- **High-Quality Summaries**: Generates coherent and contextually relevant summaries.
- **Customizable Model**: The architecture can be adapted for different datasets and text summarization tasks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
